# Drill09

This drill has you doing 4 tasks that help you practice working with lambda functions.  
Start this drill as you have done with previous drills. Download the files from piazza,
and create a new package in eclipse. Place the downloaded files in the package you created.
Then implement the following methods in Drill09.java.

## returnAddTwoLambda

This function should return a lambda function that takes an integer as input and 
returns that integer plus 2.

## returnConcatToHelloLambda

This function should return a lambda function that takes a String as input and 
returns that String concatenated to the "hello" string.

## returnAvgWithThreeLambda

This function should return a lambda function that takes an integer as input and 
returns that integer averaged with 3.

## returnConcatWith1n2ListLambda

This function should return a lambda function that takes a List<Integer> as input and 
returns a List with the numbers 1 and 2 and then the given list concatenated afterwards.
