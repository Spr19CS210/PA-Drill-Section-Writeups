For this section, imagine that you have been hired by the university to update the UAccess back-end code. To no one's surprise, the code is broken, and terribly styled.

Your task for this section is to go through and fix the code so that it not only works, but it abides by the style guidelines expected in this course. This includes camel casing, no instance variables being public, commenting, and so forth. 

The best method of doing this section would be to first get the code to work, with no errors. After that, there are roughly 10 style changes that need to be made.

Additionally, there is a tool which you might find useful in eclipse for creating getter and setter methods in your classes. After declaring an instance variable, hover your mouse over the yellow underlined variable name, and select "create getter and setter for <varName>." After this, in the pop up menu, rename the methods, or leave them as they appear. After you complete this menu, the methods will be automatically written.
